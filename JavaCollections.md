# Java collections 

## Priority Queue 
Javaâ€™s java.util package includes the PriorityQueue class, implementing a priority queue via a binary heap. Elements within this priority queue are ordered based on their natural ordering or a provided comparator.
It is easy to create "min heap " in java ,
Example : 
  PriorityQueue<Integer> q = new PriorityQueue();

But in order to create Max Heap you have to create Comparator there are few ways to do that . 
1. By extending comparator class - We can simple extend Comparator class that is present inside java.util.Comparator
   Ex-
   '''java
   import java.util.Comparator;
   public class MyComparator extends Comparator<Integer> {
     public int compare(Integer x, Integer y){
     return y-x;
     }
   }
   To call this comparator we have to provide initial size of the PriorityQueue that will extend in future with Object of your comparator .

   PriorityQueue < Integer > q = new PriorityQueue< size , new MyComparator() ) ;

2. Insted of creating our custom comparator we can use Collections.reverseOrder() funtion to get the Max Heap .
   Ex-

   PriorityQueue <Integer> q =new PriorityQueue<size, Collections.reverseOrder());

3. Using lamda expression on the PriorityQueue instead of creating any kind of Comparator .
   Ex -

   PriorityQueue < Integer > q = new PriorityQueue ( size , ( o1 , o2 ) -> o2 - o1 );


## some common methods are 
| Method Name            | Use                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add(E e)`              | Inserts the specified element into the priority queue. If the element is `null`, it throws `NullPointerException`. |
| `offer(E e)`            | Inserts the specified element into the priority queue, returning `false` if the element cannot be added. |
| `peek()`                | Retrieves, but does not remove, the highest-priority element in the queue. Returns `null` if the queue is empty. |
| `poll()`                | Retrieves and removes the highest-priority element in the queue. Returns `null` if the queue is empty. |
| `remove()`              | Removes a specific element from the priority queue. Returns `true` if the element was removed, `false` otherwise. |
| `clear()`               | Removes all elements from the priority queue. |
| `size()`                | Returns the number of elements in the priority queue. |
| `isEmpty()`             | Returns `true` if the priority queue is empty, otherwise returns `false`. |
| `contains(Object o)`    | Returns `true` if the specified element is present in the queue, otherwise `false`. |
| `toArray()`             | Returns an array containing all the elements in the priority queue. |
| `comparator()`          | Returns the comparator used to order the elements in the queue, or `null` if the elements are ordered by their natural ordering. |
| `forEach(Consumer<? super E> action)` | Performs the given action for each element of the priority queue. |
