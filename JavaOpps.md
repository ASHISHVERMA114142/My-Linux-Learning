### Can We Override the `main()` Method in Java?

No, we cannot override the `main()` method in Java because it is declared as `static`. Since static methods are associated with the class rather than an instance of the class, they cannot be overridden.

### Java Access Modifiers with Method Overriding

When overriding a method in Java, the access modifier of the overridden method (i.e., the method in the subclass) must not be more restrictive than that of the method being overridden in the superclass.

### Rules for Java Method Overriding

1. **Same Method Name**: 
   - The overriding method in the subclass must have the same name as the method in the superclass that it is overriding.

2. **Same Parameters**: 
   - The overriding method must have the same number and types of parameters as the method in the superclass. This ensures compatibility and consistency with the method signature.

3. **IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)**: 
   - Method overriding requires an IS-A relationship between the subclass and the superclass. The subclass must inherit from the superclass, either directly or indirectly, to override its methods.

4. **Same Return Type or Covariant Return Type**: 
   - The return type of the overriding method can be the same as the return type of the overridden method, or it can be a subtype of the return type in the superclass. This is known as **covariant return type**, introduced in Java 5.

5. **Access Modifier Restrictions**:
   - The access modifier of the overriding method must be the same as or less restrictive than the overridden method in the superclass:
     - A `public` method in the superclass can be overridden as `public` or `protected`, but **not private**.
     - A `protected` method in the superclass can be overridden as `protected` or `public`, but **not private**.
     - A method with **default (package-private)** access in the superclass can be overridden with `default`, `protected`, or `public` access, but **not private**.

6. **No Final Methods**:
   - Methods declared as `final` in the superclass **cannot** be overridden in the subclass. This is because `final` methods cannot be modified or extended.

7. **No Static Methods**:
   - Static methods in Java are resolved at **compile time** and therefore cannot be overridden. If a method with the same signature is defined in the subclass, it is considered as **method hiding**, not overriding.
